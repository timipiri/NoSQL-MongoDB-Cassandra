# NoSQL-MongoDB-Cassandra
In this project, I implement steps to import and export data into MongoDB and CassandraDB.
I also write queries with aggregate functions. I also create an index to speed up queries.
Tools used in this project include MongoDB, Apache Cassandra and CQL.
Snippets of the codes used have been provided.
